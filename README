-Neuronet : A Proof-of-Learning based ecosystem for training AI models and knowledge sharing. 

-Decentralized AI training & validation network powered by blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML),
training framework would allow machine learning models to evolve in a transparent, verifiable,
and community-driven manner without requiring centralized control. 

-Traditional AI development relies on private datasets, corporate oversight, and opaque decision-making, 
lacking public verifiability and fair incentive structures.

- Hashing proof-of-learning commitments into an immutable ledger, ensuring that training efforts are transparent, 
irreversible, and censorship-resistant. By leveraging zero-knowledge SNARKs

- Fork the repo, submit PRs.
