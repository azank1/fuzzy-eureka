- [ ] Add metrics collection system
- [ ] Create API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Medium Priority (Stage 1-2)
- [ ] Add more sophisticated task analysis (LLM-based)
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used agents
- [ ] Add telemetry and observability
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Implement load testing framework

### Low Priority (Stage 2-3)
- [ ] Optimize data structures for large agent pools
- [ ] Add more agent adapter types
- [ ] Create visual workflow designer
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for routing strategies
- [ ] Add ML-based agent recommendation
