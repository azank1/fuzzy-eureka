## 💡 Key Insights

### What Went Well
1. **Systematic Approach** - Breaking into stages made complex project manageable
2. **Test-Driven** - Writing tests first caught bugs early
3. **Documentation** - Clear docs made development faster
4. **Iterative Refinement** - Multiple iterations improved quality
5. **Performance Focus** - Optimization from day 1 paid off (50x better)

### What We Learned
1. **Agent ID Resolution** - Registry keys vs manifest IDs need careful handling
2. **Type Safety Matters** - TypeScript caught numerous bugs
3. **Integration Tests Critical** - Unit tests alone don't verify full system
4. **Performance Exceeds Expectations** - Modern JS/TS is very fast
5. **Documentation is Code** - Well-documented systems are maintainable

### Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Fixed Planner agent resolution bug
- ✅ Enhanced MockAdapter flexibility
- ✅ Cleaned up documentation clutter
- ✅ Removed redundant files
- ✅ Standardized on TypeScript

### Remaining Technical Debt (Stage 1)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation warnings in test files
